                One of our key focus areas is Social Emotional Learning (in
                partnership with a US Youth Leadership organization: “Growing
                Leaders”), mentoring, and leadership development. We believe
                this is something that our young people need, especially in such
                challenging and unprecedented global times. We also prioritize
                the holistic development and wellbeing of our students, their
                families, and our staff and faculty, providing periodic group
                counseling sessions for parents and students with a
                PRC-registered Guidance Counselor. We provide genuinely caring
                support for families, and host monthly Parenting Peer Groups
                (PPGs), which are gatherings (online/virtual if in-person is not
                possible) of small groups of parents to provide moral support
                and academic support to one another. FCA accepts students from
                diverse backgrounds, religions, and walks of life. Our primary
                language used for teaching and communication is the English
                language, except for the subjects of Filipino, Araling
                Panlipunan, and certain topics under Home Economics and
                Livelihood Education/Technology and Livelihood Education.
